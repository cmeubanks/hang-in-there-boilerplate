# Hang In There!

### Description
Feeling down? Feeling discouraged? The 'Hang In There!' app was designed to inspire users to reach for the stars! 'Hang In There!' generates motivational posters that can help turn your life around! Do YOU want to inspire others? Create your own motivational poster using the custom template! Posters can be saved as a reminder that if you dream it, you CAN achieve it!

### How it Works
- A random motivational poster is generated when the page loads
- The user can either save the current poster, or generate another random poster using the "Show Another Random Poster" button
- The user can create their own poster using the "Make Your Own Poster" button
- Posters can be saved/removed in the saved posters gallery using the "Save This Poster"/"Show Saved Posters" buttons

### Technologies Implemented:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Future Updates
- An alert to prevent users from creating a poster using an invalid image link
- Ability to share posters on social media
- CSS styling to make the page elements dynamic for different screen sizes
